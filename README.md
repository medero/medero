### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I'm Meder

I'm a software engineer who's passionate about working on products that make the world a better place. Technologies I'm versed in and enjoy include ReactJS, Vue, Typescript/Javascript, Python, PHP, and Postgresql/MySQL.

I like to share what I learn and contribute to the community: 
- My stackoverflow portfolio is in the top <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/145190/meder-omuraliev">0.06%</a> as a contributor
- I was interviewed by Sitepoint in 2010 for my standout contributions to the Sitepoint Web Development forum
- I managed a cross-browser bug website/database called workarounds.org to help developers address inconsistencies due to different rendering engines

I volunteer to manage/develop a website for <a href="https://remissionbiome.org/">RemissionBiome</a> which is a project to gather data and validate a potential remission event for Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on software relating to the advancement of therapies for illnesses/diseases
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was pranked by Arnold Schwarzenegger
