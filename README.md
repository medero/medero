### Hi there 👋 - I'm Meder

I'm a software engineer who's passionate about working on products that make the world a better place. Technologies I'm versed in and enjoy working with include React, Vue, Typescript/Javascript, Python, PHP, and Postgresql/MySQL including frameworks like next.js, Laravel, Flask, & Django.

Recent work:

- I volunteered to manage/develop a website for <a href="https://remissionbiome.org/">RemissionBiome</a> which is a project to gather data and validate a potential remission event for Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about indoor air quality and co2sensors while working on a CO2 Critter project named <a href="https://co2kuki.com/">CO2Kuki</a> to bring awareness of IAQ to mitigate airborne pathogens
- 🏋️ Learning Mediapipe (AI/ML library) to track and measure human body movement such as squatting

I like to share what I learn and contribute to the community: 
- My stackoverflow portfolio is in the top <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/145190/meder-omuraliev">0.06%</a> as a contributor
- I was interviewed by <a href="https://sitepoint.com/">Sitepoint</a> in 2010 for my contributions to the Sitepoint Web Development forum
- I managed a cross-browser bug website/database called workarounds.org to help developers address inconsistencies due to different rendering engines
